## Code
### Multiple line code
``` cpp title="Hello.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    >=

    return 0;
}
```

``` python title="Hello.py"
print("Hello, world!")
```

### Inline code
No language`print("Hello, world!")`
Specify language`#!python print("Hello, world!")`

### Code annotation
``` yaml
theme:
  features:
    - content.code.annotate # (1)
```

1.  :man_raising_hand: I'm a code annotation! I can contain `code`, __formatted
    text__, images, ... basically anything that can be written in Markdown.

Text can be {--deleted--} and replacement text {++added++}. This can also be
combined into {~~one~>a single~~} operation. {==Highlighting==} is also
possible {>>and comments can be added inline<<}.

Formatting can also be applied to blocks by putting the opening and closing
tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.
